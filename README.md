# Food Deserts - Data mining, Data inference via Ensembling

## Reseach question 

  What is the relationship between food deserts and demographic/geographic factors such as race, income, rural/urban environment, etc?
  
---

## Information about Datasets
  - Food Deserts in the U.S. Dataset on Kaggle
  - Data is pulled from the USDA Food Access Research Atlas, and contains information on supermarket access at various distances
  - Combines Food Access data with other fields such as age, race, rural/urban, income, etc.

## Methods applied

### Dimensionality Reduction
- PCA 
- t-SNE
- Autoencoder 

### Unsupervised Learning 
- k-means clustering

---

## Conclusion
  - Nearby census tracts are generally clustered together (Regional/Statewide trends)
  - Lower income areas have more issues with food access and food deserts
  - Unclear/inconclusive evidence of clustering together via race
  - Clustering of tracts may have a rural/urban component
